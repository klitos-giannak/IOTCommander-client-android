# IOTCommander-client-android

This is the client application for the IOT Commander service. You can download a build directly from
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.duckseason.iotcommander)

The idea is that you are running one of the servers on your IOT device regardless of platform, and
then you are able to discover your device in the local network and control it with this app or even
directly sending commands through your terminal or browser.

Check the available server applications:

[Javascript server](https://github.com/klitos-giannak/IOTCommander-server-javascript)



IOTCommander was created with IOT devices in mind, for example
- turn your LED-strip on or off
- save a picture from your smart custom-made security camera

but it's made in such a generic way that you can use it for more advanced stuff, for example
- Search on Google and show me the results on my pc
- start playing X song on Spotify on my raspberry-pi hooked on my TV
